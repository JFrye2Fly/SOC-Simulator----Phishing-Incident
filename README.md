## Introduction

In this project I investigate the results of a phishing incident by using VirusTotal, Splunk and log analysis, and Open-Source Intelligence to detect malicioous activities versus false positives. 

Tools used: 
- Splunk 
- Sysmon (Windows System Monitor)
- Virus Total
- Open-Source Intelligence 



## Conclusion

In this project it was found that a bad actor accessed and exfiltrated data from user Michael Ascot's account.
